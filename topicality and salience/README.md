<p>The referents topics are infered using Hierarchical Dirichlet Processs (HDP) with uncollapsed gibbs sampling. The code for the HDP is adapted from the implementation by <a href="http://github.com/kzhai/PyNPB/tree/master/src/hdp">Ke Zhai</a>.</p>
<p>The dataset used was the training set for the <a href="http://stel.ub.edu/semeval2010-coref/node/7">first task</a> of the <a href="http://stel.ub.edu/semeval2010-coref/">SemEval 2010</a>.</p>
<p>The script <b>main_topicality.py</b> performs all the procedures and tests explained in N. Orita et. al. (2014), except for the log-likelihood ratio test for the logistic regression models. This last test is executed in the script <b>topicality_test.R</b>, which uses as data the file <i>lr_models.csv</i> (generated by main_topicality.py).</p>
